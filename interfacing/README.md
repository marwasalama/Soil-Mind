# ESP32 Interfacing Project

This repository contains modules and examples for interfacing with the ESP32 microcontroller, including **UART, ADC, GPIO, and PWM**.  
It provides a clean structure for handling communication, sensor readings, pin control, and PWM output.

## Features

### UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
- Send and receive serial data
- Support for multiple baud rates
- Example usage for communication with PCs or other MCUs

### ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
- Read analog signals from sensors
- Configurable resolution
- Example: reading voltage from potentiometers or sensors

### GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
- Control digital pins (High/Low)
- Configure pins as input or output
- Supports interrupts and event handling

### PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
- Generate PWM signals on configurable pins
- Adjustable frequency and duty cycle
- Example usage for controlling LEDs or motors
